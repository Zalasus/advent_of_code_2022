Zal's Advent of Code 2022
=========================

Hey, I'm stuck on a train right now and am two hours late! Did you know the german train service is
horrible? Anyways, since I got a bit of spare time right now, might as well do this thing again.

Written in Rust, because german mobile internet is *also* horrible and I can't download any other
toolchain or interpreter, or even listen to music for that matter. Glad at the very least SSH works.
Sorta.
